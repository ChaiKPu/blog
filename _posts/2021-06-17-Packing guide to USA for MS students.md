**CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ADMIT !**
{:.btn .btn--success .btn--block .btn--disabled}

You have completed some challenging admission processes, visa interview preparations and now you are excited towards your travel ! The journey from now on will be towards making you more independent and responsible. You will be away from your family and country, thus you need to plan your travel and luggage accordingly.

Here is a list of things you need to carry and some tips that would have helped me better if I had known them prior to my flight.

### <i class="fas fa-folder-open"></i> Documents that you need to bring

Make sure to securely pack these documents, if possible in a folder with an index sheet to help you know which documents you have in the folder. You will be adding more documents as you travel to USA - Offer letters, SSN related documents, updated i20's, i94, Tax documents, residential proofs like electricity bills etc.<br><br>
If you are required to produce any of these documents in future, make sure you keep them back safely in the same folder once its purpose is met.

**Make sure to visit all the banks you have an account in and make them a joint account with your parents**
